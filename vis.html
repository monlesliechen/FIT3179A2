    <h1>Australia Fire Events from 2019-10 to 2020-01</h1>
    <p>Australia fire event has always been a big problem. <br>The bushfires burned more than <span class="bold">46
            million</span> acres (<span class="bold">72,000
            square miles</span>) â€“ roughly the same area as the entire country of Syria. <br>We collected fire data from
        <span class="bold">Oct 2019 to Jan 2020</span> and visualize the data to analyse and improve our solutions.

    <!-- summary -->
    <p>
        The map below tells us the locations of each fire event and how severe the event is. We can see from the graph
        that the majority of the fire area is located at the costal area. <br>You can select a particular time period at
        the bottom
        line chart as a time brush, the fire events that happened between this period will reflect on the map and
        highlight
        the worst rating in that period.
        The line chart at the bottom implies that the majority of fire events happened during summer. Especially the day
        around New Year.
        <br>A clearly rise as the temperature goes higher at <span class="bold">06 Nov 2019 and 01 Dec 2019.</span>

        These two graphs tell us the distribution of fire incidents during the day. The probability
        of a fire at night is almost half of that during the day. <br>Surprisingly, the night did not help
        us control the fire well. Despite the temperature drop, the fire rating is still high.
